## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hey! I’m Vitor Corrêa, a developer who enjoys solving problems with code, keeping things clean and scalable, and doing everything as functionally as possible (yep, **no classes here** 😄).

Some quick facts about me:
- I'm deep into **TypeScript** and backend development  
- I love working with **DDD and decoupled architecture**

But life’s not just code, right?  
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me:
- chilling at the **beach** to relax 🏖️  
- riding my **bike by the shore** 🚲  
- or playing some **footvolley or freestyle football** with friends ⚽🌊
